//4 - 3 // 1


// Example of the division operator(/):
//6 / 3 // 2


// Example of the multiplication operator(*):
//10 * 9 // 90


// create a variable named score
//var score;
// and store the number 0 in it
//let score = 0;
// here we take the variable score and assign it to add whatever
// amount is in score currently plus 100;
//score = score + 100;


// Assignment Operators
// there are shorthand methods for performing each basic mathamatical equation

//score = score + 10; // score += 10;
//score = score - 20; // score -= 20;
//score = score * 5;  // score *= 5;
//score = score / 2;  // score /+ 2;

// find out how many seconds there are in a day

// challenge: find out how many seconds you have been alive
// I created 2 new variables. One to hold the amount of years i have been 
// alive and one to hold the amount of days in a year.
// in the previus exercise we calculated the amount of seconds per day
// then i took that variable and multiplied against the other 2 created variables
// and thats how i got my solution the second exercise


/*const daysPerYear = 365;

const yearsAlive = 30;

const secondsAlive = secondsPerDay * daysPerYear * yearsAlive;


console.log(`Ive been alive for more than ${secondsAlive} seconds`)*/
