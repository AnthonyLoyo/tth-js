// a ELSEIF clause is used to provide multiple program paths with numerous conditions.

// Exercise:
// in this exercise we create a weather variable and give a value of snow.
// next we create a if statement with multiple conditions to be tested instead of just 2, we do this by using a else if clause. this gives the ability to test mulitple conditions in a if statement. 
// in this if statement we want to do a activity based on the weather. 
// our variable is then ran through our if statment and tested against mulitple conditions using the else if clause.
// the weather variable is then tested against the  if, else if and else statements conditionals. once one of the conditionals in the if, else if or else statements is strictly matched to the value inside weather it excutes that code block and logs the message into console.
