// in JavaScript there are multiple ways to capture user input
// one of these ways is through the 'promot()' method
// 'propmt()' lets you ask the user a question with a pop up box
// and it stores the information it recieves which later you 
// can call uopn and or use.

// Example: 
// const name = prompt("what is your name?");
// console.log(name);
